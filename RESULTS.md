# Gemma Integration Results

## Summary

We've successfully integrated Gemma models with the PyTorch 2.2.0 and Transformers 4.53.0 environment. The main compatibility issues were addressed through patches and workarounds.

## Working Components

1. **Model Loading**: 
   - Successfully loading Gemma 2-2B with 4-bit quantization 
   - Applied compatibility patches for `torch.get_default_device()` and security restrictions

2. **Inference**:
   - Successfully running text generation with the loaded model
   - GPU memory usage optimized using 4-bit quantization

3. **LoRA Setup**:
   - Successfully applied PEFT LoRA configurations to the model
   - Confirmed trainable parameters are correctly identified

## Remaining Issues

1. **Training with Transformers Trainer**:
   - Device mapping issues with the Accelerator
   - Errors in `prepare_model` within the training pipeline

2. **DeepSpeed Multi-GPU Training**:
   - DeepSpeed multi-GPU distribution encounters device mapping errors
   - Further investigation needed for full training setup

## Recommendations

1. **For Inference**:
   - Use the `gemma_inference_test.py` script which includes all necessary patches
   - Prefer safetensors format with explicit device mapping

2. **For Training**:
   - Consider upgrading to PyTorch 2.6+ for full compatibility
   - Alternative: Use a custom training loop without the Transformers Trainer
   - Further investigate DeepSpeed integration for multi-GPU training

## Next Steps

1. Investigate solutions for training compatibility:
   - Test with different versions of PyTorch/Transformers
   - Explore custom training loops that avoid accelerator issues

2. Optimize multi-GPU utilization:
   - Test alternative distributed training approaches
   - Consider tensor parallelism solutions

3. Scale up dataset and model size when training issues are resolved

## Testing Commands

Run inference:
```bash
./run_inference.sh
```

Test model loading with memory tracking:
```bash
python scripts/inference/gemma_inference_test.py --use_4bit
```
